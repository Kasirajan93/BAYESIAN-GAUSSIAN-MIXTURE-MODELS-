Bias and Variance in Machine Learning
-
This repository contains a presentation that explains the Bias-Variance tradeoff, one of the most important concepts in machine learning model evaluation.

📖 Overview
-
Machine Learning models often face two major sources of error: Bias and Variance.

Bias: Error due to oversimplified assumptions (leads to underfitting).

Variance: Error due to over-complexity and sensitivity to data (leads to overfitting).

Finding the right balance between these two is key to building robust, accurate, and generalizable models.
